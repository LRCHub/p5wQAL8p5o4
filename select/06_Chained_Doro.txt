Do unto others
As you have them do to you
It would make our life so easy
Yeah, there's gold in that rule

But money is a God
For so many in this world
Yeah, they wanna own the souls
Of every man, woman, boy and girl

It's sad but true to see
It is them against you and me

But we are chained
Chained, chained for life
We are chained
Chained till we die

And together we will fight
For what we know is right
Yeah we are chained
Chained, chained for life

We are chained, chained, chained, chained
We are chained, chained, chained, chained

Angels walk among us
But there are devils out there too
And they cast their evil on us
Hoping we'll do what they want us to do

Turnin' love into hatred
Makin' dreams become untrue
And the only thing that's sacred
Is the bond between me and you

It's sad but true to see
It is them against you and me

And we are chained
Chained, chained for life
We are chained
Chained till we die

And together we will fight
For what we know is right
Chained
Chained, chained for life

We are chained, chained, chained, chained
We are chained, chained, chained, chained

There's evil all around us
But I don't fear it
It's time to raise our voices
And let them bastards hear it, watch out

And together we will fight
For what we know is right
We are chained, chained, chained for life
We are chained, chained, chained, chained

Chained
Chained, chained for life
We are chained
Chained till we die

And together we will fight
For what we know is right
We are chained
Chained, chained for life

We are chained, chained for life
We are chained, chained for life

We are chained, chained, chained, chained, chained
We are chained, chained, chained, chained, chained
We are chained, chained, chained, chained, chained
We are chained, chained, chained, chained
