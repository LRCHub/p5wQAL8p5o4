Slumbering in swamps
Drowned my purest power
For centuries to see
A dawn to come

I watch it every step it takes
As it grabs mu thorned soul
Coiled in black ulcers
Wounded to feel the pain in joy

Wounded to stand the suffering
And see them be condemned for ever
Hurt to grow black scars
To show them all our might

See them come in bloody streams
Formed by living satanic dreams

The sound of humans poundering heart
That stole so many precious moments
Is stabbed to silence, and turned to wonder

For us, sounds of lovely pain.

A touch of death stains their souls
Above where angles dwelled
Above all might defenced of life
And whom in every man shall be remembered

Buried in a bloodred doom
No end shall find a key
To set them free and relieve their burdens
Nothing is to be forgiven
