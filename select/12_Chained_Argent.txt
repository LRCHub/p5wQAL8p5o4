Free like a bird as it flies
Free like an old man that dies
Just like a stream, or a rose growing wild
Somewhere, there's someone walking the road
Somewhere someone who carries the load
Don't look too far to see somewhere there's a man

God bring the day
God bring the day
God bring the day when we won't have to lay there...
Chained

God, why don't you let them go?
Why? That's I want to know
Pray to the Lord and you give thanks that you're free
Somewhere there's a magical sun
Somewhere and then no evil is done
Where there's a devil whip and there ain't a man

Chained...

Repeat x 4

God bring the day
God bring the day
God bring the day when we won't have to lay there...
